# React Showcase Application

## Purpose

The React Showcase application is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of React.js by showcasing various features or items. This project serves as a portfolio piece, highlighting the use of components, custom hooks, and API integration. It provides a clean and interactive interface for users to explore the showcased items.

## Functionality

- **Header Component**: Displays the title of the application and navigation links.
- **Showcase Component**: Fetches and displays a list of items from an API using a custom hook (`useFetch`). This component is the core of the application, showcasing the dynamic data retrieval.
- **Footer Component**: Contains copyright information and additional links for user navigation.
- **Custom Hook (`useFetch`)**: Manages data fetching, loading states, and error handling, providing a reusable solution for API calls.
- **Styling**: The application is styled using CSS to ensure a visually appealing layout.
